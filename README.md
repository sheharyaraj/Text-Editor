# Text-Editor
This text editor uses various data structures to implement data compression along with word suggestions.

You only need the source code and the attached 'sorted dictionary.txt' file which will contain the words that would work as a dictionary for our suggestions.
This dictionary however contains dummy data so you can change the words to your liking.
Upon saving a file a compressed file of the data would also be created.

How to use the functionalities:
- If you want to ask for suggestions while you are typing in a file press '=' and hit enter for example if you want suggestions after the word 'ca' you 
  have to type 'ca='.
-This should show you another promt where you can either select a suggested word by pressing ';' which will replace the unfinished word with the suggested word.
-if you want a different suggestion since an unfinished word may have multiple suggestions you can press '/' to cycle suggestions.
